				I'm a self-taught UX Designer with a love for games, green-tea, sashimi, and high fantasy. I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2018 where I studied Computer Science for 2 years and earned a degree in English. In my spare time I love talking and mentoring folks in video games and design careers. You can usually find me nerding over classic literature, being tempted to order sushi, or experimenting with creating small interactive experiences in different mediums.

				Asides from design, I also just enjoy making things in general. From slice-of-life comics to developing 2D games about mental health and anxiety, I like to spend my personal time exploring the boundless ways to be creative (and trying to find the discipline to stick to one project!) But other than that, here's also a list of other cool(ish) things I've done/do:

			<div class = "image-work-description">
			I really enjoy talking to folks about design, getting into the games industry, and mental health. In college, I was an aimless student with very little guidance torwards where I wanted my career to be so now I strive to give back when I can.
