			Expiry is an imaginary food delivery service that only delivers food that are just reaching their shelf life. Expiry operates under a "mysteru box" subscription that allows users to place same-day orders. My task was to redesign the experience to have an easier placement of orders given the limited supply of food.

			<div class = "image-work-title">Epithet Wars</div>
			<div class = "image-work-description">Inspired by a talk given by Kevin Martens, I wanted to create a game that tested the limits of exaggerated animations. Epithet Wars is a single-player 2D fighting game that uses a turn-based combat system based with overblown animations. The game concept was inspired by the Greek Goddesses, and the attacks are based on the Homeric Epithets of each goddess.</div>

			<div class = "image-work-title">World of Warcraft (Spellbook &amp; Abilities)</div>
			<div class = "image-work-description">Inspired by painful user experience memories of playing WoW, I decided to redesign the Spellbook &amp; Abilities interface so that no player would have to get that fustrated over navigating their own abilities ever again. I had 3 goals to my redesign:<p><p>1. To simplify all ability-related interfaces into just one interface while retaining all existing functions.
			<p>2. To use the interface to complement learning abilities in a meaningful way.
			<p>3. To ensure that the interface is affordant, and that interactions and gestures are consistent and clear.</div>
