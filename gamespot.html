				At CBS Interactive, I worked with the Games Group which manages GameSpot, Giant Bomb, and Comic Vine. My time was spent on redesigning GameSpot's website. GameSpot went through a redesign 3 years ago, but the profile page had been neglected for a long time. My task was to redesign the profile page on GameSpot to improve the user experience, flow, and engageability. Unfortunately, I can not show any of my designs here but I can talk about my processes behind them.

			With such a large and open-ended project, a lot of my time was spent on higher organizational thinking in order to find the right direction to take the profile. My design processes included:
                    <div class = "bullet">Researching competitors</div>
                    <div class = "bullet">Studying user analytics</div>
                    <div class = "bullet">Grouping features into buckets to seek patterns</div>
                    <div class = "bullet">Creating affinity diagrams</div>
                    <div class = "bullet">Brainstorming actionable solutions</div>

			<div class = "image-work-description">I mockuped the first iteration of the profile and made clickable prototypes. For user testing, we interviewed a few interns &amp; four GameSpot moderators. I also proposed a new 'Games I Follow' feature that became the most positively recieved feature.</div>
