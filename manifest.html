				Manifest is a 2D emotional platformer that revolves around a mechanic called Morph, a temporary movement ability that allows you to fly. This game was made as the final project for my Game Design and Development Class at the University of California, Berkeley. Out of 40 pitch ideas, my game idea was 1 of 8 chosen to form a team for development. I lead a team of 4 (myself as a hybrid programmer/artist and 3 other programmers) and we implemented the game in Unity.

			<div class = "image-work-description">Inspired by Jenova Chen's 2016 GDC talk, I wanted to explore the genre of video games that utilized the unique playing experience of mystery and awe. I created a presentation and pitched my game idea to 40 UC Berkeley students. My pitch became 1 of 8 pitches (out of 40 pitch ideas total) to be voted by the class to form a team for development.</div>

				I created a Game Design Document and organized a schedule for the team to meet weekly. We hosted biweekly playtests to get feedback on both game funtionality and the player experience with our game mechanics and iterated over the feedback. I proposed a second mechanic called 'Purification' to give the player a short-term, mid-term, and long-term motivation to traverse the game.
