				Mage Supreme is a mobile battle royale game and the first Western-rooted game from NetEase Games. I was brought on to aid the product team shortly before the launch of the game's Closed Beta Testing. I directly contributed to the overall development and polish of the game such as leading the redesign of various game flows and creating interfaces, animations, artwork, and icons for multiple features. The game is currently released for Closed Beta Testing in two countries, Canada and Brazil.

			<div class = "image-work-title">Process &amp; Prototypes</div>
			<div class = "image-work-description">My design processes would vary from feature to feature. Generally, I would spend time ideating and brainstorming the necessary design interactions and flows a feature required. Then I would create mockups and prototypes of my designs and work with UX Researchers to conduct internal UI testing. After multiple iterations and approval from both Game Design &amp; Engineering, I would implement my designs in Unity and iterate based on playtesting feedback.

				I designed and implemented many features in the game, many of which required a new redesign to improve interactions with states that were previously not accounted for. I also created assets and animations for most of the features. Features that I directly contributed to include:

			<div class = "image-work-description">In addition to simplifying the battle flow, I aided in the design of Spectate Mode, Quick Chat, and Party Management outside of battle (Leaving Party, Inviting Friends To Battle, and Accepting Battle Invites). During this process, I also redesigned the game's Header to be consistent throughout all game screens.</div>

I created a majority of the screenshots and implemented all the combined assets into Unity. These screens are also used as our Loading Screens.</div>
